;
;	Change History (most recent first):
;
;	  <SM19>	 11/9/93	KW		added some eieioSTP macros.  Only expands for CygnusX1 ROM.
;	  <SM18>	 9/29/93	SAM		From mc900ftjesus.
;	   <MC3>	 9/25/93	SAM		Whoot! What a mess.  Removed usless/redundant entry points and
;									imports/exports by the thousands.  Cleaned up tons of stuff.
;									Changed the labels of a few routines to reflect the fact that
;									they apply to both egret and cuda. Export ChkFirmware for
;									vectorization.  Backedout change <SM17>.
;	  <SM17>	 9/23/93	PN		Add condition for Egret
;	  <SM16>	 7/12/93	kc		Re-roll in ShiftRegIRQPatch to fix Quadra 900-950 ReadTime bug.
;	  <SM15>	 12/1/92	RB		Turned off the debug feature in Egret.
;	  <SM14>	11/20/92	GS		Removed the CudaPDMPatch from the initialization of the DFAC and
;									PDMs for Caboose or Cuda.  This initialization for Cyclone is
;									now done in the Gibbly.
;	  <SM13>	 11/3/92	SWC		Changed ShutdownEqu.a->Shutdown.a.
;     <SM12>    10/02/92    AEK     Conditionalize call to InitReliabitity to keep it from being
;                                   called twice if not on an overpatched ROM
;
;	  <SM11>	 9/18/92	GS		Debug Enter - removed PDMSuspend command.  DebugExit - add
;									MacsbugContinue command,   add Window update.  EgretDFACandPDM
;									routine - removed the Keybd NMI enable for the Cuda FW.  In the
;									Cuda FW, the command to enable/disable Keybd NMI no longer is a
;									valid command.  Keybd NMI is always enabled with the Cuda FW.
;	  <SM10>	 6/26/92	GS		(RBM)  Removed the Enable KeyboardNMI call made in the
;									EgretDFACandPDM
;									routine.  With the new version of Cuda FW (Cuda 0.22), the NMI
;									is always ON.
;									No longer has entry in the pseudo cmd table for SetDFACmode.
;									Instead, a new
;									command exists, called RdWrIIC to perform bidirectional IIC
;									transactions.
;									This requires special setup of the Cuda globals by the routine
;									'SetTransferParams' (see CudaMgr.a).
;									
;	   <SM9>	 5/24/92	RB		Removed the routine QuadraEgretChanges since EgretDFACandPDM is
;									a better version from the Pandora ROM. This routine gets called
;									from StartInit.a
;	   <SM8>	 5/24/92	RB		Removing "patches" as they get rolled into the other
;									sources...PowerSwitchIntPatch is out.
;	   <SM7>	 5/23/92	RB		Making Cyclone changes...Revised some patches rolled in from
;									Terror. Pandora comments follow: with some duplications... Note
;									that a lot of this code should be reworked with the ADBMgr, the
;									first step is to get it all in... **** From EgretPatches.a: <P2>
;									4/24/92 GS Added a Egret Dispatch call to suspend/continue PDM
;									when entering exiting Macsbug. This is to prevent problems of
;									determining whether or not to ignore PDM messages. **** From
;									EgretMgr.a: <P4> 2/10/92 GS Exported the PseudoTable for use by
;									the CudaMgr.a code. Cleaned up some comments. <P3> 02/07/92 jmp
;									Added some padding so that Pandora matches Horror. <P2> 1/16/92
;									GS Added code to determine the Egret Firmware Type (Egret8,
;									Caboose, Cuda), then set up the appropiate vectors for IRQ,
;									Ticks, Dispatcher...

;	 								 Pre-Pandora ROM comments begin here.
; ———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
;		 				<5>	 2/20/91	BG		Fixed error in CheckPacket. The check for allowable
;									pseudo-packets was a hard-coded name check instead of an
;									end-of-table check.
;		 				<4>	12/11/90	JJ		Mac LC: Changes references to VISAChipBit to V8ChipBit.
;		 				<3>	 12/7/90	CCH		Adjusted the patch code in CheckPacket so that it fits in the
;									same number of bytes as the original code.
;		 				<2>	 12/6/90	BG		(with GA) Rolled in Eclipse-related Egret/Caboose changes.
;						<P9>	 4/24/92	GS		Removed DSorDebuggerPatch that was called from StartErr.a  New
;									code and PDM Selectors used by PDM removed the need.  Updated
;									the DebugUtil code in EgretPatches.a to handle these cases.
;						**** From EgretPatchesToo.a:
;						<P8>	 4/24/92	KW		(SWC,H5) Moved ADB and DebugUtil routines to ADBPrimitives.a.
;						<P10>	  4/10/92	gjs		Make Timer Mgr Task fire off a Cuda Tickle pkt every 3 sec 
;									instead of 7 secs.  Still having problem with 2nd User Alert
;									with mulitple hits to Keybd Reset key.  Also bump up the Timer
;									Timeout passed back to Cuda.
;						<P9>	  4/08/92	gjs		Upon installing a TimeMgr task to tickle Cuda during the User
;									alert, send a tickle to cover the first 7-10 seconds of the
;									display of the alert.
;						<P8>	  3/30/92	GS		The KeyBdSwHandler has been changed to set up a User Alert 
;									if the KeybdPower switch has been depressed, or if the 
;									chassis swithc or Secure Key switch has been used for a power down
;									a deferred Task will be executed, with out a User Alert.
;						<P7>	  3/17/92	GS		The PowerSwitch Int Handler has been changed to user the new
;									ShutDown mgr code in the system.  This makes all _ShutDown trap
;									calls with the selector set to 1 a soft power off.
;						<P6>	  3/3/92	GS		Update some Cuda Code to save some regs in Tickle timer code,
;									and begin to setup for the new power down msg to indicate kybd
;									or chassis sw power down.
;						<P5>	02/11/92	jmp		The EgretDFACandPDAM routine (which used to be the
;									EclipseEgretPatches routine) got bigger, so I moved it into the
;									pad space, with a branch from the original location.
;						<P4>	 2/11/92	GS		Update the Cuda Patches used to support SoftPower On/Off. Added
;									comments and revision tags. Updated a patch label from
;									EclipseEgretPatches to EgretDFACandPDM to better describe the
;									function of the patch. Also added functionality to the patch to
;									handle Caboose and Cuda firmware initializations.
;						<P3>	02/07/92	jmp		(jmp,H3/BG,Z19) Fixed ReGenSoundInt to wait in between disabling
;									and re-enabling sound interrupts.  Also changed ReGenSoundInt to
;									work like Kip originally intended (i.e. regenerate interrupts
;									only on the channel(s) that need it).
;						<P2>	 1/16/92	GS		Rolled in the newPatches that are associated with the Cuda
;									firmware for SoftPower On/Off.
; ———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
;	  								Pre-Pandora ROM comments begin here. (EgretPatchesToo)
; ———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
;						<H2>	12/21/91	jmp		(BG,Z18) Added code to re-generate sound interrupts when
;									checking the keyswitch values since reading port B causes
;									interrupts to get cleared (stupid design of original VIAs).
;
;	   <SM6>	 5/17/92	kc		Roll in Horror sources. (prepend via equates with v)
;	   <SM5>	 5/13/92	SES		Fixed bug in ShiftRegIrq patch roll in. Additional sr restore
;									instructions were added only where necessary instead of trying
;									to restore "globally" right before exiting.
;	   <SM4>	  5/5/92	SES		Rolled in patches from PatchIIciROM.a, including ShiftRegIrq
;									patch for saving/restoring sr, and addition of SCC polling in
;									EgretDispatch. Also fixed minor bug in tickHandler where
;									with/endwith directives were left out.
;	   <SM3>	  5/4/92	FM		fix typo
;	   <SM2>	  5/4/92	FM		Roll in changes from PatchIICiRom.a file that were "lost" in the
;									review process… Changing the TickHandler to update the Time
;									lo-mem global so that the RdDateTime can simply return whats in
;									the global.
;		<21>	 1/20/92	KC		Move RequestDonePatch into ADBMgr.a. Changed
;									CheckForCabooseKeyswitch into TestFor KeyswCabooseBit macro
;									call.
;		<20>	 1/13/92	kc		Added Terror changes, origional comments below.
;		 {?}						Added "Enable PDMMessage" and "SendDefault DFAC" to PseudoCntTable.
;		 {5}	 2/20/91	BG		Fixed error in CheckPacket. The check for allowable
;									pseudo-packets was a hard-coded name check instead of an
;									end-of-table check.
;		<19>	12/29/91	RB		Added Terror changes and rolled in patches to support Quadras.
;		<18>	 8/30/91	JSM		Cleanup header, don’t include SysErr.a since it’s in
;									StandardEqu.d.
;		<17>	 6/12/91	LN		removed #include 'HardwareEqu.a'
;		<16>	 4/24/91	dba		fix warning
;		<15>	10/22/90	JJ		Rex V8: Change VISAChipBit to V8ChipBit.
;		<14>	 5/15/90	GA		Removing calls to SCCPollDelay. Routine not needed.
;		<13>	  5/8/90	GA		Disabled all interrupts during interrupt handler to prevent
;									AppleTalk from interrupting Egret Manager and the issuing a
;									ReadXPram call which calls Egret Manager Synchronously. Changed
;									the Delay100 routine to SCCPollDelay. It polls and buffers any
;									serial data from the SCC and calls the Serial Driver PollProc
;									routine if one is present. Modified SendEgretCmd to have a retry
;									count to communicate with Egret. If the Retry count expires,
;									EgretMgr calls Error1Handler. Modified SendPtype to read the
;									interrupt flags register in the via 32767 times (≈41.9 millsecs
;									max) and then try send the packet type again based on the retry
;									count.
;		<12>	 4/25/90	GA		Fixed a bug with SendDFAC to allow 1 to 4 bytes to be sent to
;									Egret. Fixed a bug with the error reporting mechanism to return
;									all 4 bytes of the error packet returned by Egret.
;		<11>	 4/10/90	GA		Fixed a bug in the error checking code. Made a change to make
;									KeyLite program work (returns parameter block byte count
;									unchanged).
;		<10>	  4/2/90	GA		Removing the Routine Read LastByte from the SendEgretCmd code.
;									Also, fixing lines of source which have had their C/R changed to
;									a Null ($00) character. We suspect that Romlister may trash
;									source files which are open during the build.
;		 <9>	 3/30/90	GA		Added Error reporting for bad parameter blocks from the system
;									to Egret.
;		 <8>	 3/22/90	GA		Changed the Via_Full Ack process on the last byte of
;									transactions to clarify the Logic Analyzer displays.
;		 <7>	 3/15/90	GA		Ray and I added conditionalized code to send Stop Autopoll and
;									send mode 0 one second interrupt command s in place of the
;									SendNOPCmd to support the B3 release of Egret. This code will be
;									inactivated when the final Egret parts come in.
;		 <6>	 3/13/90	GA		Added a routine called SENDNOPCMD. This routine is register
;									driven and issues a command to Egret to Stop AutoPoll and one
;									second interrupts in Egret
;		 <5>	  3/9/90	GMR		Optimized code in a few places. Moved assertion of SysSes bit to
;									after test of XcvrSes, to fix bug on 2 byte tick packets.
;		 <4>	 2/28/90	GMR		Rewrote file.
;		 <3>	 2/14/90	GA		Added support code for Restart & shutdown in Egret. Issues stop
;									autopoll & stop 1 sec interrupts prior to restarting the system.
;		 <2>	  2/9/90	GA		1. Added two calls to DelayLoop to give Egret time to see
;									transitions of SysSession signal.
;
;									2. SendWithCheck & SynChkSend now wait for the shift register
;									   interrupt bit to be asserted before exiting when a transaction
;									   is aborted.
;
;									3. Moved code which sends bitmap and starts autopoll to Egret into
;									   EgretMgr.a.  ADBMgr now issues a JSR StartEgretAutopoll to do
;									   the same function.  This makes the Erickson overpatch easier.
;

;	Routine:	EgretDispatch 9bfa
;
;	Function:	This is the Egret manager trap routine.  It waits for Egret to be idle, sends
;				the first byte of the command packet.  If Egret didn't abort, then it sets up
;				globals for the IRQ handler, and if a completion routine was specified, it returns
;				back to the caller.  If no completion routine, then it waits synchronously for
;				the command/response to finish, using the busy bit.  When the IRQ handler has finished
;				the response packet, it preps the globals to expect an auto-response packet
;				(ticks or ADB), clears 'busy' and calls the completion routine (if any).

; <SM22> FM This patch was rolled in from the PatchIIciRom.a file.
; <SM22> FM Its purpose is to keep the tim lo-mem up to date at
; <SM22> FM interrupt time so that the RdDateTime trap can simply
; <SM22> FM read the Time lo-mem global.
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;	This patch fixes a bug in Egret Manager TickHandler routine.						<89><101>
;	The routine will store the 32 bit time passed by Egret to the
;	system if the packet is a ReadRealTime into TIME lowmen.
;	Decrements the lowmem Time by one to compensate for the interrupt
;	Handler incrementing it by one and then calls the LVL1DT interrupt
;	handler.
;	If the packet is a tick packet then it calls LVL1DT to increment the
;	time setting and check the alarm state.
;
;	Entry:
;		A1.l = Points at Response data buffer At Flags byte:

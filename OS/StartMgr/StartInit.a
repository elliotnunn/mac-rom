;
;	Change History (most recent first):
;
;	 <SM163>	  2/2/94	DCB		Added call to INITSCSIBOOT so that it gets called after Slot
;									Interrupts and ADB are initialized.  It used to be called from
;									SCSIMgrInit but that was too early and screwed up third party
;									SIMs.
;	 <SM161>	 1/28/94	chp		For TNT: allow most everything except the .Sound driver.
;	 <SM160>	  1/4/94	LB		For TNT: allow floppy driver installation.
;	 <SM159>	12/13/93	PN		Roll in KAOs and Horror changes to support Malcom and AJ
;									machines.
;	 <SM158>	 12/2/93	chp		For TNT: allow serial driver installation.
;	 <SM157>	11/10/93	chp		For TNT: enable VIA interrupts for SetUpTimeK; install a
;									pseudo-slotVBL interrupt for PCI video cursor tracking; disable
;									several drivers.
;	 <SM156>	 11/9/93	KW		added some eieioSTP macros.  Only expands for CygnusX1 ROM
;	 <SM155>	 11/8/93	SAM		Roll in <MC7> from mc900ftjesus.
;	   <MC7>	 11/8/93	SAM		Removed some confusing, misleading, and commented out code to
;									adjust gestalt's lram size (following initgestalt).
;	 <SM154>	10/25/93	SAM		Roll in <MC6> from mc900ftjesus.
;	   <MC6>	10/25/93	SAM		Moved the call to CheckforResetPRAM a little earlier in the boot
;									(just following the Cuda/Egret init).
;	 <SM153>	10/15/93	SAM		Roll in <mc5> from mc900ftjesus.
;	   <MC5>	10/15/93	SAM		Deleted the NuBusReset code for Bart (leftover from the last
;									checkin).  Removed the code that created the bogus "heap"
;									gestalt selector.
;	 <SM152>	10/12/93	SAM		Roll in <MC4> from mc900ftjesus.
;	   <MC4>	10/12/93	SAM		Moved the Bart Nubus reset from here to USTStartup.  Made the
;									figment "heap" gestalt setup universal.
;	 <SM151>	 10/4/93	JDR		undo change SM150. it was already being done in SndPrimitives.a
;	 <SM150>	 10/1/93	KW		Installing tables for sound primitives. Allows Quadras/Wombats
;									to record, set volume level etc. Great if moved to SoundMgr
;									initialization code.
;	 <SM149>	 9/28/93	SAM		From mc900ftjesus.
;	   <MC3>	 9/26/93	pdw		Added NOT hasAsyncSCSI around call to InitSCSIHW since
;									InitSCSIMgr does the hardware init when AsyncSCSI is present.
;	   <MC2>	 9/25/93	SAM		Removed the build time conditional around the call to InitEgret.
;									Added a runtime check to EgretDFACandPDM.  Cleaned up the
;									intialization of SoundBase (again). Changed CheckForEgret to
;									CheckForEgretOrCuda. Removed PDM Evt1 support from NuBusReset &
;									DynamicBoxFlag
;	 <SM146>	 9/13/93	SAM		Updated the Gestalt heap install stuff.  Initialized the
;									HeapUtilities globals ptr .
;	 <SM145>	 9/12/93	pdw		Split up InitIOMgr into InitIOPStuff, InitDeviceMgr and
;									InitDrivers.
;	 <SM144>	  9/3/93	GMR		Changed bit used for BART slot disable from bit 0 to bit 7. Also
;									fixed a problem found by Fernando in RdVidParam that causes us
;									not to boot if we have a video card without on-board video
;									connected.
;	 <SM143>	 9/1/93		SKH		Finish SetupTimeK export.  (Forgot to add change history)
;	 <SM142>	 9/1/93		SKH		Export SetupTimeK because the portable dynamic speed stuff needs it
;	 <SM141>	 8/23/93	pdw		Added support for LimitPRAMClear, IgnoreCmdOptShDel,
;									LoadDefaultOnly - three options required for AIX security,
;									enabled by setting bits in PRAM $76.
;	 <SM140>	 8/20/93	BG		Modified DynamicBoxFlag to know about CarlSagans.
;	 <SM139>	 8/20/93	chp		Rather than calling InitPDMDMA explicitly from StartInit,
;									install that routine as an interrupt initialization postproc in
;									the AMIC interrupt primitives table. (See InterruptHandlers.a).
;									It is executed as part of the call to InitIntHandler.
;	 <SM138>	 8/16/93	RC		Made changes to CheckForResetPRAM routine.  I added support for
;									saving off some of the PRAM information which is needed for
;									security reasons (mostly needed by the AUX team)
;	 <SM137>	 8/12/93	SAM		Undid the last two changes (not needed).  Added code to
;									NuBusReset to disable Slot E IRQs for multiple slot PDM style
;									machines with a BART NuBus controller.
;	 <SM136>	 8/12/93	KW		adding two more smurf wombats
;	 <SM135>	 8/11/93	KW		added some branches based on new smurf boxes
;	 <SM134>	  8/4/93	JDR		Integrate sound manager 3.0 project.
;	 <SM133>	  8/3/93	GMR		Added code to issue a NuBus reset on PDM machines with BART.
;									Ideally, this should be before diagnostics....
;	 <SM132>	 7/20/93	SAM		Changed the name of the offset in the new ROM header that points
;									to the 7.0 toolbox init code to be "InitSys7ToolBoxOff" instead
;									of InstallMgr which wasn't very descriptive.  Added code to
;									create 768 master pointers in the System heap at its creation.
;									This will help keep the sys heap from becoming fragmented.
;	 <SM131>	  7/9/93	PN		Remove my last change
;	 <SM130>	  7/2/93	PN		Add conditional hasCPUIDregister
;	 <SM129>	  7/1/93	KW		Set SoundBase to ROM address 40800000 if ROM is in RAM.
;	 <SM128>	 6/29/93	SAM		Added code to install a "heap" gestalt selector if Figment is
;									around.
;	 <SM127>	 6/29/93	SAM		Commented out the code that added the Edisk size to the
;									*physical* RAM size!  All logical RAM size adjustments are made
;									from within Gestalt (as it was).
;	 <SM126>	 6/24/93	SAM		Updated PDM's dynamic boxflag code to include a new set of
;									"boxes" (fridge).
;	 <SM125>	 6/22/93	kc		Setuo parameter to FROVideo before calling it.
;	 <SM124>	 6/21/93	kc		Fix InitIOMgr so that it doesn't trash a0 (and the UnitTable).
;	 <SM123>	 6/17/93	rab		Moved initialization of expandmem to before InitIntHandler.
;									Fixes some boot problems caused by the Ludwig roll-back.
;	 <SM122>	 6/14/93	kc		Roll in Ludwig.
;	  <LW17>	 4/14/93	fau		Made the CheckForTV use CivicExists, instead of BoxFlags.
;	  <LW15>	 4/11/93	chp		Rewrite serial driver installation code in InitIOMgr. Use
;									ProductInfo to select the correct 'SERD' resource.
;	  <LW14>	  4/9/93	fau		Changed the EdiskDriver to use the InstallDrvr routine so that
;									it doesn't stomp on a previously installed driver.
;	  <LW13>	  4/8/93	fau		Changed the open of the netboot driver to use the InstallDrvr
;									routine, so it uses the lowest refnum above -47, instead of the
;									resource id.  This is much more friendly.
;	   <LW7>	 2/16/93	ejb		move initialization of realtime mgr, rt drvr, and dsp std snd to
;									gibbly so that strings and icons can be localized.
;	   <LW6>	 2/11/93	PW		Removing IMPORT of SCSILoad (it's not used in this file).
;	 <SM121>	  6/3/93	SAM		Chas.  I thought we had an agreement here...  Added dynamic
;									boxflag hack for HMC machines.
;	 <SM120>	  6/1/93	CSS		Touch this file so Universal ROM version can be updated (v $02).
;	 <SM119>	 5/18/93	CSS		Touch this file so Universal ROM version can be updated (v $01).
;	 <SM118>	  5/9/93	SAM		Removed bogus soundmgr init code that was writing an
;									uninitialized value into the sound mgr globals.
;	 <SM117>	  5/7/93	joe		& CCH.  Bumped MinSysExtra constant to compensate for all the
;									new stuff being thrown in.  It's previous size was causing
;									booting problems on PDMs and Smurfs.
;	 <SM116>	  5/6/93	SAM		Removed some _SwapMMUMode calls.  Fixed ConfigureRAM to not
;									write past the top of RAM if the RAM size is not a multiple of
;									64k.  Changed another one of those nasty SIGNED address
;									comparisons.
;	 <SM115>	  5/5/93	CSS		Touch this file so Universal ROM version can be updated (v $00).
;	 <SM114>	 4/20/93	CSS		Touch this file so Universal ROM version can be updated.
;	 <SM113>	 4/11/93	chp		Rewrite serial driver installation code in InitIOMgr. Use
;									ProductInfo to select the correct 'SERD' resource.
;	 <SM112>	  4/8/93	SAM		Added calls to "INSTALLBASSCOMMON" and "FORCEINITFONTSCALL" to
;									initalize Bass before the first call to _InitGraf (which calles
;									_InitFonts).
;	 <SM111>	  4/1/93	GMR		Moved PDM's DMA stuff to InterruptHandlers.a.
;	 <SM110>	 3/31/93	GMR		Fixed a bug in PDM's DMA handler when dealing with bits 8,9.
;									Optimized the handler. This stuff belongs in InterruptHandlers.a, 
;									and will be moved there soon.
;	 <SM109>	 3/31/93	chp		Remove support for Cyclone EVT3 (limited changes from Ludwig).
;	 <SM108>	 3/25/93	RB		In order for interrupt handlers to run from RAM when running a
;									virtual ROM, the InfoRecord needs to be adjusted so it points to
;									its RAM copy.
;	 <SM107>	 3/11/93	SAM		Indirection, indirection.  Why use one instruction when you can
;									use two.  Lvl5IrqHandler.
;	 <SM106>	 3/11/93	SAM		Added a check before the adjustment to total ram size before
;									InitGestalt that wont adjust anything if the EDisk was not
;									stolen from the 68k mmu tables.  Added a refCon to the DMA irq
;									handler.
;	 <SM105>	  3/4/93	RC		Added check of AMIC to determine if we need to load the SERD 1
;									resource or not.  One line is currently commented out to keep it
;									from loading until we have fixed hardware
;	 <SM104>	 2/25/93	RB		When running from RAM, the hard coded offsets used for ROM
;									vectors need to be adjusted after calling InitROMVectors.
;	 <SM103>	 2/23/93	RC		Bug fix to the Level 5 Interrupt Handler for PDM/AMIC
;	 <SM102>	 2/22/93	RC		Use a Gestalt check around GoNative.
;	 <SM101>	 2/20/93	SAM		Ok, here goes...Added a InitDMA routine that sets up a structure
;									in expandmem for dealing with multiple DMA interrupt sources.
;									Rearranged several calls after BootRetry to 1) make more sense,
;									and 2) necessitate creating expandmem much earlier than it
;									previously was.  Moved the installation of the 040BlockMove
;									routine much earlier.  Put several Supports24Bit's round things.
;									Changed many *signed* comparisons - everyone needs to stop
;									making singed Address comparisions!  Made the GoNative install
;									universal.
;	 <SM100>	 2/12/93	PN		Change BEQ.S to BEQ.W to fix the build
;	  <SM99>	 2/10/93	RB		Reviewed by CS. Added code to copy ROM code into RAM for
;									performance. Removed some of the NOT LC930 stuff, since it is
;									obsolete after the test code Steve added.
;	  <SM98>	  2/5/93	GMR		Added check for SWIM3 in InitIOMgr, to support SonyDriver on
;									PDM. Extended SetupHWBases to deal with all 96 basesValid bits.
;									Setup IWM in SetupHWBases if SWIM3Exists.
;	  <SM97>	  2/5/93	RC		GoNative is needer for both PDM and Smurf
;	  <SM96>	  2/5/93	SAM		Temporarily conditionalize assembly of the GoNative installation.
;	  <SM95>	 1/15/93	RC		Took out the Auto Launch of RAM Disk on PDM
;	  <SM94>	 1/10/93	RC		Added more nops for Smurf
;	  <SM93>	12/23/92	RC		GoNative turned back on
;	  <SM92>	12/21/92	SWC		Pulled InstallPrivTrap out of the has040MMU conditional since it
;									installs the correct routine into the trap for both an ‘881 and
;									an ‘040 style FPU.
;	  <SM91>	12/17/92	RB		Removed some of the LC930 conditionals now that Steve added a
;									bunch hasPwrControls conditionals. Changed some of the other
;									LC930 conditionals to use has2MegROMOrMore. Others were changed
;									to has040. Re-enabled some 24 bit mode code with the conditional
;									Supports24Bit.
;	  <SM90>	12/11/92	RC		Temporarily comment out the Branch to GoNative until the
;									GoNative code is a little more ready for the ROM
;	  <SM89>	12/11/92	SWC		Rearranged stuff at BootRetry so that machine/feature specific
;									support can be setup earlier so there's not a gray region where
;									the world is kinda set up.
;	  <SM88>	12/10/92	JDB		ejb: Fix my ENDIF
;	  <SM87>	12/10/92	ejb		remove code for installing RTSndIn Driver- as this is not
;									needed.  The SoundMgr will take care of this.
;	  <SM86>	 12/8/92	RC		Installing GoNative as soon as Resource manager and memory
;									manager are up and alive
;	  <SM85>	 12/8/92	SWC		Fixed an LC930 gotcha from <SM84>.
;	  <SM84>	 12/8/92	SWC		Moved LCDScreenChk->PowerMgr.a. Cleaned up the backlight, DSP
;									driver loading since some pieces of code were duplicated 3
;									times. Did some general cleanup and removed unused code.
;     <SM83>	12/06/92	HY		Remove space in .Sound and .EDisk definitions as a result of 
;									change in <SM82> which preceded strings with STRING PASCAL directive.
;									This caused the EDisk and Sound drivers from being loaded.
;	  <SM82>	 12/5/92	SWC		Moved InitSndHW, InitSndNoRAM to SndPrimitives.a. Removed the
;									ASC test before the call to InitSndHW since that routine will
;									now do what's appropriate for each machine. Cleaned up the
;									initial low mem setup. Removed the PowerBook 140 boxFlag patch.
;	  <SM81>	 12/4/92	SWC		Moved InitMemMgr->MemoryMgr.a, InitRsrcMgr->ResourceMgr.a,
;									InitDTQueue->DeferredTaskMgr.a, SwitchMMU->MMU.a.
;	  <SM80>	 12/3/92	PN		Back out the change in SM72 since a better fix is implemented in
;									Startboot.a
;	  <SM79>	12/02/92	HY		Zeroed out memory on stack before calling InitEgretAlt. This could 
;									potentially cause sporadic crashes on RESTART. Also changed 
;									InitHiMemGlobals to use BaseOfROM to decide where BufPtr should
;									be set to in 24-bit mode (LC based machines are at $00A00000).
;									Bracketed call to EnableSwimIOPInts in InitIOMgr with "IF hasIopSwim".
;	  <SM78>	 12/2/92	SWC		Moved PortableCheck to PowerManager.a.
;	  <SM77>	 12/2/92	ejb		move installation of RTSnd beforeRTDrvr since driver now calls
;									StdSndSignInCPUDevice
;	  <SM76>	 12/1/92	SWC		Removed the call to EnableParityInts since it was only used on
;									the IIfx (and has gone away).
;	  <SM75>	11/25/92	PW		Changed minSysExtra value from 16K to 64K to attempt to (and
;									apparently did) fix the many drivers-not-loading bugs (NewPtr
;									failed).
;	  <SM74>	11/24/92	RB		In the SetApp_Base routine, put support for 24 bit mode.
;	  <SM73>	11/20/92	fau		Put a test around InitSndHw so we don't call it if an ASC doesn
;									not exist.  Enabled MUNI Interrupts on Cyclone.
;	  <SM72>	11/19/92	PN		Radar #1050264 the SetAppBase patch needs to be rolled in
;									correctly. At the early init time, the patch to the _SetAppBase
;									is not needed. Yet we roll the patch into SetApplBase routine so
;									we have to replace _SetAppBase with JSR SetApp_Base so that the
;									_InitApplZone is not called.
;	  <SM71>	11/14/92	kc		Export MyROM.
;	  <SM70>	11/11/92	RB		The code that sets MemTop should be executed before Gestalt is
;									initialized. Moved the code to earlier in the boot process. Put
;									back the old Sound Manager (7.1) for the LC930, since Sadism is
;									not ready.
;	  <SM69>	11/11/92	GD		Made a change to support Romulator for PowerBooks.
;	  <SM68>	 11/7/92	rab		Roll in Horror changes. Comments follow: • From StartInit.a •
;		<H11>	 8/25/92	BG		Modified SetupTimeK so that the VIATime loop is unaligned. This
;									'fixes' a problem with the floppy driver doing a wait loop that
;									is unaligned and taking too long, causing MFM writes to occur
;									too late.
;		<H10>	 7/21/92	NJV		Removed hasSonora1 conditionalized code (no longer needed)
;		<H9>	 7/13/92	GMR		Now initialize ExpandMem before InitADB so we can initialize the
;									CrsrDev stuff when InitADB is called.
;									• From StartInitPatch.a •
;		<H19>	 9/13/92	NJV		Added initialization of DJMEMC's new diagnostic register on a
;									warm start (the Sound Block Configuration Register).
;		<H16>	07-01-92	jmp		Made the change in <H13> only take effect on warm-starts.
;		<H13>	06-26-92	jmp		Added some code to InitSoundHW that checks for the presence of a
;									djMEMC.  If a djMEMC exists, this code then shuts off the
;									djMEMC’s (DAFB’s) sync control so that video is off BEFORE the
;									boot beep occurs.
;		<H12>	 6/24/92	ag		Added Dartanian to the list of cpu's which must use the sound
;									pan registers for volume control. Allow Zero volume which will
;									mute the boot beep. Zero volume is only achived if the user set
;									it to zero, invalid pram will default to level 5.
;	  <SM67>	11-04-92	jmp		Cleaned up the enable cache code to be a little more
;									maintainable.
;	  <SM66>	 11/4/92	mal		Put back enable cache code that was erroneously removed in rev
;									64.   Removed 2nd StartInit.a from end of file that was
;									erroneously added in rev 64.
;	  <SM65>	 11/3/92	RB		Changed the use of LC930 in the 24 bit mode support test to
;									Supports24Bit. Change the include of SCSIEqu.a to SCSI.a,
;									VideoEqu.a to Video.a and ATalkEqu.a to AppleTalk.a
;	  <SM64>	 11/3/92	fau		Together with Mlaw:  Loaded a new SoundBase that points to the
;									start of the MarioBootSound in ROM, instead of the middle of
;									ROM.  Also, chaned the gestalt in <SM59> to use a TestFor macro,
;									as it is much faster.
;	  <SM63>	 11/2/92	fau		Added a check on Cyclone/Tempest to determine if the user has
;									Cmd-opt-T-V held down (if so, it will allow for booting off
;									without a monitor, directing output to the composite video
;									port).
;	  <SM62>	10/30/92	RB		On the LC930, do not force 32 bit mode, since it supports 24 bit
;									mode.
;	  <SM61>	10/29/92	RB		Removed the temporary ADBReinit call I added because it takes a
;									long time. Added a low ROM address for InitROMVectors since the
;									intl' OS guys need it.
;	  <SM60>	10/27/92	CSS		Changed some short branches to word branches.
;	  <SM59>	10/27/92	fau		Used gestaltSoundHardware to determine whether to install the
;									sound interrupt handlers for ASC machines.
;	  <SM58>	10/22/92	fau		Moved ADBReinit <SM56> to before grayscreen, so that the user
;									won't see a frozen mouse.  This call should just be temporary
;									and a fix to the Q950 should be found.  ADBReinit takes like 1
;									second to execute!
;	  <SM57>	10/22/92	fau		Got rid of all MMCExists by making them DSPExists or PSCExists.
;	  <SM56>	10/22/92	RB		Exclude any PowerManager calls from the LC930 build (1 Meg ROM).
;									Call ADBReInit at Startup to fix the mouse freeze bug in 950's.
;									Made the startup port be the one that Boot3 expects as defined
;									in the BootGlobals.
;	  <SM55>	10/18/92	CCH		Added a nop to flush pending writes and a RAM Disk on PDM.
;	  <SM54>	10/12/92	RB		Exclude 040 specific code from the LC930 1 Meg ROM build.
;	  <SM53>	 10/7/92	CSS		Fixed so only non-cyclone machines will load the SoundDriver which
;									is now back in ROM.  This is a hack to get the sound volume on Quadra to
;									work.
;	  <SM52>	 10/6/92	RB		Added the ROMinRAM conditional to avoid RESET when buidling a
;									ROM that will be copied to RAM in order to do testing. Killed
;									the register to use with some of the BIG macros, since the
;									macros have been updated for 68020's.
;	  <SM51>	 10/5/92	PN		Fix MacII si booting process with InitROMVector after InitMMU
;	  <SM50>	 10/2/92	PN		Set 32bit mode in PRAM
;	  <SM49>	 9/18/92	kc		Change InitVectors to InitRomVectors. Change short branches to
;									long branches.
;	  <SM48>	  9/8/92	chp		Install default primary SCC interrupt handlers as soon as the
;									PSC dispatch table is set up on Cyclone, and enable SCC
;									interrupts once and for all. InitSCC rewritten to remove
;									unnecessary code left over from pre-ADB Macs.
;	  <SM47>	 8/26/92	kc		Roll in Horror changes.
;		<H9>	 7/13/92	GMR		Now initialize ExpandMem before InitADB so we can initialize the
;									CrsrDev stuff when InitADB is called.
;		<H5>	 2/12/92	SWC		Added a call to InitCrsrDev in InitCrsrMgr so that the new mouse
;									acceleration stuff can be installed. Moved call to InitCrsrMgr
;									to just after ExpandMem is initialized since the CrsrDev stuff
;									keeps its globals there.
;	  <SM46>	 8/26/92	PN		Set SoundBase global to a safe location since it is no longer
;									valid.  Apps that write to this address will safely write to
;									ROM.
;	  <SM45>	 8/19/92	CSS		Update from Reality:
;									<72> 8/18/92 DTY	Change the name of BootGlobs to StartGlobals to avoid confusion
;														with BootGlobals, which is used by the boot code in Boot[1-3].a.
;	  <SM44>	 8/17/92	CCH		Extended universal support to 96-bits.
;	  <SM43>	08-11-92	jmp		Added ReAnimator support for ’030 CPUs (taken straight from
;									HORROR).
;	  <SM42>	  8/9/92	CCH		Added conditional StartPC address for Smurf cards.
;	  <SM41>	 7/28/92	WS		Init DSP now use gestaltRealtimeMgr instead of checking the box
;									flags
;	  <SM40>	 7/27/92	RB		The ExpandMem record should be allocated just after we have a
;									System heap. When the resource Manager is called some of its
;									routines use the ExpandedMem record, which was being allocated
;									way after many things called the Resource Manager. Main bug
;									fixed was trashing SCCRd for the serial drivers.
;	  <SM39>	 7/24/92	RLM		move initGestalt before InitIOMgr, this allows lockmem calls
;									from initNewAge, note GetEDiskSize in initGestalt no longer
;									requires the drivers to be installed, also InitSCSIMgr comes
;									after InitIOMgr per Pauls request
;	  <SM38>	 7/15/92	JDB		Removed the code to install the SoundInput driver (it was
;									commented out and unnecessary).
;	  <SM37>	  7/9/92	RB		The Sound Manager was not working right on the Quadras because
;									the routine to enable the interrupts from the old Sound Manager
;									needed to be called and it wasnt.
;	  <SM36>	  7/7/92	RB		Added back a call to INITIALIZESOUNDMGRCOMMON from the sound
;									manager for sound input.
;	  <SM35>	  7/6/92	RB		Put back InitSndDispatch and InitMACEDispatch because Jim says
;									we need them after InitSoundMgr.
;	  <SM34>	 6/29/92	RB		Removed the old calls to initialize the sound manager and
;									replaced it with a new call, InitSoundMgr for the new new sound
;									manager.
;	  <SM33>	 6/25/92	kc		Do what I said I did last time.
;	  <SM32>	 6/25/92	kc		Disable the data cache on Cyclone until after InitSlots. This is
;									to work around a bug in MMC that will be fixed in EVT4. The
;									problem is caused when MUNI asserts TEA and another buss master
;									starts a transation befor MMC times out. The new MMC will watch
;									for TEA as well as TA for cycle termination.
;	  <SM31>	 6/25/92	PN		Put in init routine for WindowMgr to allocalte an extend memory
;									varialble
;	  <SM30>	 6/25/92	ejb		Add code to initialize RTSnd (DSP Standard Sound). Added and

;									name as it exists in this scope.
;	  <SM16>	 5/24/92	RB		Making Cyclone changes...Updated some of the old comments which
;									seemed to have been cut-off by some tool. Call EgretDFACandPDM
;									from the Pandora roll-in instead of QuadraEgretChanges. Added
;									code that installs the DSP Manager at runtime after checking for
;									Cyclone. Initialize dbLite docking bar and scsi disk mode. Check
;									for LCD screens instead of PowerBook 170 boxflags. Added New Age
;									driver installation code. Deleted some old SE30 patch. 
;									••• LCDScreenChk, SCSIDiskMode commented out temporarily.
;	  <SM15>	 5/23/92	RB		Changed a bsr to bsr.l, also made the SuperMario ROM release id
;									field a word, so I had to change its location.
;	  <SM14>	 5/22/92	FM		Turned off vectorization temporarily
;	  <SM13>	 5/21/92	RB		Defined the location for the SuperMario ROM version which will
;									be used to determine which vectors to load from disk.
;	  <SM12>	 5/21/92	kc		Append "Trap" to the name of DTInstall to avoid name conflict
;									with the glue.
;	  <SM11>	 5/16/92	kc		Roll in Horror changes. Comments Follow: • From StartInit.a •
;		<H7>	  4/8/92	SWC		Modified InitHiMemGlobals to force BufPtr to be at least
;									"bufWorldSize" bytes (currently 8K) below the top of RAM so
;									Macsbug won't load into [DBLite's] sound buffer and get trashed
;									when a sound is played.
;		<H6>	 2/19/92	JC		Define PatchFlags in unused byte of ROM header ($0014).
;		<H5>	 2/12/92	SWC		Added a call to InitCrsrDev in InitCrsrMgr so that the new mouse
;									acceleration stuff can be installed. Moved call to InitCrsrMgr
;									to just after ExpandMem is initialized since the CrsrDev stuff
;									keeps its globals there.
;		<H2>	 9/10/91	CMP		Overpatched InitIWM to handle SWIM2 chip
;									• From PwrControlsPatches.a •
;	   <H14>	 4/24/92	HJR		Provided Econo-Mode support for Niagra.
;	   <H10>	 3/16/92	SWC		Added support for 33MHz MSC systems to CheckEconoMode.
;		<H9>	 2/21/92	HJR		Modified check sleep to use new ram locations instead of
;									obsolete VRam space.
;		<H8>	 2/10/92	HJR		Fix a bug where we are returning from a BSR6 without setting the
;									return address in A6.
;		<H7>	  2/7/92	SWC		Modified the CheckEconoMode code to lookup the correct base
;									Power Manager PRAM address from the primitives tables.
;		<H6>	 1/24/92	SWC		In CheckEconoMode, do both econo-mode setup and chip
;									configuration for the MSC case.
;		<H2>	  8/8/91	SWC		Added import of USTPMGRSendCommand and modified the econo mode
;									code to use it instead of sending the bytes discretely.
;									Universalized the ADB code so that it supports interrupts on CA2
;									and PMGR auto-polling for DB-Lite.  Fixed PortableCheck so it
;									handles the case when VRAM doesn't retain power across sleep
;									(state saved in PMgrGlobals).  Added EnableSCSIIntsPatch so we
;									won't enable SCSI interrupts on DB-Lite.
;									• From StartInitPatch.a •
;		<H7>	12/18/91	SWC		Modified InitSWIM2 to check for the existance of registers as
;									well as doing a bus error check since the final MSCs in DB-Lite
;									don't generate a bus error if the chip isn't there.
;		<H5>	10/30/91	SWC		Added a check to InitSWIM2 to first check if the chip is even
;									installed (bus error) to support DB-Lite where the SWIM chip is
;									on an external board that may or may not be connected at startup
;									time.
;		<H2>	 9/11/91	CMP		Added InitSWIM2 to support SWIM2 chip.
;	  <SM10>	 4/22/92	RB		Added a call to vector initialization routine of the Window
;									Manager, which is temporarily vector $2000. This is for
;									experimentation.
;	   <SM9>	 4/15/92	RB		The 040 BlockMove was fixed almost immediately after I broke it.
;									So I am re-enabling that code back. Removed the bullets in
;									comment in <SM3> so that we know it's been taken care of. Also
;									re-enabled 040 caches.
;	   <SM8>	 4/14/92	kc		Remove call to BTreeInstall.
;	   <SM7>	 3/24/92	PN		Add new soundmgr init into the existing soundmgr initialize
;									routine. Disable 040 caches.
;	   <SM6>	  3/4/92	kc		Remove the 7.0 manager initialization calls.
;	   <SM5>	  3/4/92	PN		Adding a vector for InstallMgr
;	   <SM4>	  3/4/92	kc		Add call to _InitFS and comment out call to the install TimeMgr
;									patch.
;	   <SM3>	  3/4/92	kc		Rearange the ordering to get around interdependencies. Added the
;									code from StartBoot.a that initializes the managers 
;									 We need to fix the 040 BlockMove 
;	   <SM2>	 2/12/92	RLM		Roll in PatchMDJGNEFILTER PatchProc. 
;									• Pre-SuperMario Comments Follow •
;		<71>	 1/30/92	KC		(Really JSM) Change low byte of ROMVersion to $7D just to be
;									really different from $067C.

;		<69>	 1/27/92	KC		Remove call to InitNonMMU, and added runtime cpu check in
;									SwitchMMU.
;		<68>	 1/23/92	KC		Roll in Zydeco patches from StartInit.a and StartInitPatches.a
;									From StartInit.a and StartInitPatches.a
;		{30}	 5/31/91	djw		 (for SWC) Call InstallSonyDriverPatch (StartInitPatches.a) to
;									 check for the existence of either an IWM/SWIM or SWIM IOP before
;									 installing the floppy driver (for systems without floppy
;									 drives).
;									From Zydeco StartInitPatches.a: (original comments were missing)
;									 Added hasEDisk and forRomulator conditionals.
;									 Removed call to InitOverPatch and InitVidGlobals.
;									 Removed InitVidGlobals stub.
;									 Rolled in OpenNetBootPatch and EDiskPatch2 and ConfigureRAMPatch.
;									 Changed WhichCPU to use the data instead of instruction cache.
;									 Added code to check location of boot globals in InitHiMemGlobals.

;									 InitEgretAlt which were deleted in last revision.
;									 Moved call to GetPRAM to before the call to InitMemMgr.
;									 Added call to InitMemoryDispatch, InstallPrivTrap, InstallFPSP and InitNonMMU.
;		<67>	 1/15/92	KC		Fix comment from last checkout.
;		<66>	 1/15/92	KC		Resolve BootGlobals name collision caused by moving the
;									BootGlobals record into BootEqu.a (changed BootGlobals to 
;									BootGlobalsSize & QDBootGlobals to QDBootGlobalsSize).
;		<65>	  1/3/92	RB		Install an optimized BlockMove for 68040 based CPUs.
;		<64>	12/31/91	RB		Use RAMConfigBase only on HcMac
;		<63>	12/30/91	RB		Need to export INITSNDNORAM since the new boot beep code calls
;									it.
;		<62>	12/29/91	RB		Removed the implementation of ElsieTranslate24to32 since it is
;									in a QuickDraw file too.
;		<61>	12/27/91	RB		Open backlight driver on machines with Power Mgr.
;		<60>	12/27/91	RB		Added Terror changes.
;		<59>	11/16/91	DTY		Replacing hard addresses with a record to make the equates “more
;									universal” is nice but useless if the code has no way of getting
;									to those addresses any more.  Add equates for VidRAMSleepFlag
;									and VidRAMWakeVect to this file to keep the ROM build building
;									until the hardware guys figure out what they’re trying to do.
;		<58>	10/17/91	JSM		Get rid of all the stupid conditionals.
;		<57>	 10/2/91	JSM		Use MemoryMgrPriv.a instead of HeapDefs.a.
;		<56>	 10/1/91	JSM		Don’t use onMvMac conditional, Modern Victorian never existed.
;		<55>	 10/1/91	JSM		Don’t use hasADB conditional, all future ROMs will support ADB.
;		<54>	 10/1/91	JSM		Don’t use eclipseDebug.
;		<53>	 9/30/91	JSM		Don’t use is32BitClean conditional, all future ROMs will be.
;		<52>	 9/27/91	JSM		Don’t use hasCQD conditional, all future ROMs will have color
;									QuickDraw.
;		<51>	 9/16/91	JSM		Cleanup header.
;		<50>	 6/12/91	LN		Changed #include 'HardwareEqu.a' to 'HardwarePrivateEqu.a'

;		<48>	 12/7/90	dba		Institute dead-code stripping.
;		<47>	10/22/90	JJ		Rex V8: Change VISAChipBit to V8ChipBit.
;		<46>	 9/24/90	BG		Changed the code at the very very start of the ROM that
;									determines whether or not the CPU involved is an 040. The code
;									first used the 040 Data Cache Enable bit in the CACR <19>, but
;									that was switched when earlier versions of the 040 died
;									immediately upon turning on the data cache. However, the correct
;									bit to use is the data cache enable bit, and this mod. switches
;									back to using that. Also changed various ugly raw constant
;									references of bits set/tested/etc. in the CACR to symbolic
;									constants defined in HardwarePrivateEqu.a.
;		<45>	 9/19/90	BG		Removed various 040-related kludges. 040s are behaving more
;									reliably now.
;		<44>	 9/14/90	MSH		Put in a fancy new universal check for wake from sleep (ok, its
;									not really elegant, you got a better idea?).
;		<43>	  9/1/90	BG		Updated to handle Eclipse EVT1 board.  Specifically - Egret
;									lowmems were only initialized if the Universal tables say that
;									we have ADBEgret.  We also needed to initialize them if we have
;									ClockEgret.
;		<42>	  7/4/90	CCH		Added check to SetupHiMemGlobals to move bootglobs if its above
;									ROM (when ROM is in RAM) and added a check that skips SCC
;									initialization if running from RAM.
;		<41>	  7/3/90	BG		Turn off 040 caches if we*re running from RAM.
;		<40>	  7/2/90	jmp		Made no changes, accidently checked out file.
;		<39>	 6/28/90	BG		Rolled in changes for Eclipse/040.
;		<38>	 6/12/90	NC		Add the calls to init all the Sound I/O Manager stuff correctly.
;		<37>	  5/8/90	JJ		Added code to disable the MemoryDispatch trap if the machine has
;									no MMU or has an HMMU.
;		<36>	  5/3/90	GMR		ConfigureRAM now merges contiguous RAM chunks into a single
;									chunk.
;		<35>	  5/1/90	DAF		Removing ELSIE Huge Hack to BufPtr
;		<34>	 4/21/90	GMR		Moved ConfigureRAM functionality to SizeMem.a, to solve problems
;									with writing the chunk table before stitching occurs. Before,
;									pages within a bank might swap (depending on bank size/location)
;									after stitching, causing the chunk table to no longer be at the
;									end of the bank.
;		<33>	  4/4/90	MSH		Removed universal test around InitPmgrVars.
;		<32>	  4/4/90	JJ		Temporary hack to make "special" setting of BufPtr take place on
;									Elsie.
;		<31>	 3/29/90	MSH		Added universal test for Pmgr initialization.
;		<30>	 3/27/90	JJ		Fixed bugs in ConfigureRAM code for VISA II.
;		<29>	 3/23/90	JJ		Replaced VISA I code in ConfigureRAM with code for both VISA I
;									and VISA II.
;		<28>	 3/22/90	JJ		Change reset vector to begin execution in overlay ROM space
;									rather than actual ROM space.
;		<27>	 3/22/90	MSH		Changes to clock.a require small modifications to the PRAM
;									calls.
;		<26>	 3/21/90	SS		Removed the Egret initiatlization code.  I moved it into
;									USTStartUp.a after the RAM tests.
;		<25>	 3/13/90	GA		Added a call to Egret to Stop AutoPoll and one second interrupts
;									prior to running Diagnostics.
;		<24>	 2/28/90	JJ		Added code to install ElsieTranslate24To32 routine as the
;									Translate24To32 trap on machines with VISA decoders.
;		<23>	 2/28/90	GMR		Changed Egret run time checks to use new equates.
;		<22>	 2/20/90	CCH		Updated some comments.
;		<21>	 2/20/90	CCH		Added routine to configure Orwell memory controller to
;									ConfigureRAM.
;		<20>	 2/19/90	NC		Put in initialization calls to the 7.0 Sound Manager if on a
;									machine with Egret. THIS WILL CHANGE WHEN A REAL FLAG IS
;									AVAILABLE!
;		<19>	 2/16/90	BG		Modified cache testing and enable/disable instructions not to
;									use the 040 data cache since it is non-functional in the current
;									rev. of the 040 silicon. Switched usage of DE to IE in places
;									where it matters.
;		<18>	 2/11/90	GA		Added endwith to with statements inside hasEgret conditionals
;		<17>	  2/9/90	BG		Added code to enable 040 caches.
;		<16>	  2/9/90	JJ		VIA CPU ID bits $1110 assigned to Elsie.  Modified InitSCC to
;									avoid addressing location 1 below SCC base address.  SCC reset
;									now done by sending $C0 command to SCC.  Add routine for VISA
;									decoder to ConfigureRAM.  Force result of CompBootStack to be
;									even.
;		<15>	  2/4/90	CV		HwCfgFlags gets read from d2, not from the universal tables.
;									With an optional FPU, the table may not have the correct value.
;		<14>	  2/4/90	GA		Added Calls to InitEgret and conditionals with Universal runtime
;									checks.
;		<13>	 1/15/90	BG		Corrected the enabling the of the instruction cache in WhichCPU.
;									Also modified comments in WhichCPU, SwitchMMU to reflect
;									reality.
;		<12>	 1/14/90	GGD		NEEDED FOR ZONE-5: Changing the order of reset/mmu disable at
;									start time to prevent possible double bus errors on machines
;									with overlay bits. Also fixed a few bugs in the 040 detection
;									code.
;		<11>	 1/11/90	CCH		Added include of “HardwarePrivateEqu.a”.
;		<10>	 1/10/90	BG		Updated WhichCPU to recognize 040s.
;		 <9>	  1/9/90	BG		Change StartBoot to be run-time detection of 040s instead of
;									assembly-time for universality.
;		 <8>	  1/8/90	BG		Changed the code at StartBoot so that it does the correct thing
;									for the 040.  Unfortunately, this is an assembly-time change
;									(for now) because the way you deal with the TC register is
;									radically different than on the 020/030, and the 040 CACR looks
;									and acts differently than the 020/030.
;		 <7>	  1/6/90	BG		Updating MMU- and Cache-related code to work correctly on the
;									040. This is assembly-time conditionalized for now but will be
;									changed to Runtime checking later (where possible).
;		 <6>	  1/4/90	BG		Adding MACHINE MC68040 directive into the SETMACHINE macro. This
;									will only be invoked if CPU = 040, a condition no one should be
;									seeing unless you do a -Mac040- build.
;		 <5>	12/27/89	SWC		Forgot to include a "WITH DecoderInfo" for the parity stuff.
;		 <4>	12/26/89	SWC		Replaced "#"s with ";"s for the following comment since the
;									AddChange script was messed up when this file got checked in.
;		 <3>	12/26/89	SWC		Setup FMC configuration to do the right thing for both parity
;									and non-parity systems.
;		 <2>	12/21/89	CCH		Fixed up comment header.
;	  <11.7>	11/28/89	SWC		Removed references to FMCRev2 since Zone 5 has the final version
;									of its memory controller.
;	  <11.6>	11/15/89	GMR		NEEDED FOR ZONE-5. Added call to EnableParityInts that sets the
;									OSS RPU's mask reg to level 7 if the RPU is present.
;	  <11.5>	11/10/89	MSH		Rolled in support for both black fill and white fill for hcmac
;									NTSCmode.
;	  <11.4>	10/31/89	PWD		Restore stack pointer after checking if the netBoot driver is
;									there before _Opening it.
;	  <11.3>	10/31/89	MSH		Took the conditional assembly of TEGlobalInit out, now always
;									assembles. Changed

;	  <11.1>	 8/23/89	SES		Temporarily add MBProcHndl to this file until all nfile
;									references in all sources are removed. Once nFiles are removed,
;									MBProcHndl should be put into ToolEqu.a.
;	  <11.0>	 8/22/89	SES		Removed references to nFiles. Changed include DeclRomEqu.a to
;									RomEqu.a.
;	  <10.9>	 8/22/89	GMR		Removed RunDiags, always call universal StartTest diags now.
;									Prep A2 with VIA1 base before calling quasiPwrMgr when reading
;									RamDisk size, to work with universal RdXByte.
;	  <10.8>	 8/16/89	BBM		made EDisk open on feature “hasEDisk”, rather than the hack
;									onHcMac.
;	  <10.7>	 7/27/89	CCH		Fixed _real_ bug that was trashing a4 in configureRam, and
;									restored fixAddr.
;	  <10.6>	 7/27/89	CCH		Fixed bug in fixAddr that was using address of bank B as it's
;									size.
;	  <10.5>	 7/25/89	CCH		Modified configureRAM for glue chip and FMC based machines to
;									adjust universal info pointers and return address on stack if
;									their addresses change as a result of setting memory size bits
;									when forRomulator flag is set.
;	  <10.4>	 7/17/89	GGD		Fixed comment from last change, added call to InitOverPatch.
;	  <10.3>	 7/16/89	GGD		NEEDED FOR AURORA: Modified the Reset PRAM key sequence to
;									preserve the Reliability manager PRAM bytes, but invalidate all

;									disabled only on F-19s with old FMCs.
;	  <10.0>	 7/13/89	GGD		Added check for Cmd-Opt-R-P keys at boot time to Reset PRAM, in
;									case PRAM contents prevents booting for some reason.
;	   <9.9>	  7/8/89	CCH		Modified to work with Romulator.
;	   <9.8>	  7/6/89	GGD		Un-Proc'd WriteSCC because code falls into it, and alignment
;									would screw it up. Changed the FMC rev 1 vs 2 code to produce
;									code that is the same size in both cases. Added some padding for
;									overpatching.
;	   <9.7>	  7/5/89	CCH		Added ROM build version to ROM Header.

;									need equate!
;	   <8.8>	 6/26/89	GMR		Exported StartTestFlags.
;	   <8.7>	 6/20/89	SWC		Replaced immediate constant with lomem variable for HcMac in

;									information around various RAM tests.
;	   <5.9>	 5/10/89	CCH		Added test for Mac II's when running in RAM that will give
;									GetHardwareInfo a hint that it's running on an 020 machine, so
;									it will not twiddle VIA bits which turn off the MMU. Also figure
;									out memory size in startinit when running out of RAM.
;	   <5.8>	 4/30/89	GGD		Implemented new improved table driven, universal, SetupTimeK
;									routine. Reworked InitSlots to remove calls to routines that

;									instead of using absolute addresses. Started converting to
;									feature based conditionals. Made Foreign OS tables available on
;									all CPUs. Cleaned up comment and code for the 4 bit CPUID field
;									extraction.
;	   <4.9>	  4/7/89	MSH		InitPmgrVars disables auto polling, loads pmgr interrupt
;									handlers, and enables pmgr interrupts. Also backed out change
;									4.8. StartTest will clear warmstart if a hard reset ocurred.
;	   <4.8>	  4/4/89	SES		Added check for PwrMgr reset on HcMac. If PwrMgr reset occurred,
;									then Ram test is run regardless of warmStart value.
;	   <4.7>	  4/3/89	MSH		Clear MMUType if no mmu exists. This area needs work to support
;									all combinations of MMUs, processors, and accelerators.

;									but BootBeep is still called in StartTest.
;	   <4.3>	 3/24/89	CCH		Added RomLoc location in Rom Header to hold information on where
;									ROM is executing from (i.e. Ram, Emulator).

;	   <3.9>	  3/6/89	GGD		Modified InitIWM to force SWIM chip to switch into IWM mode to
;									prevent looping if SWIM did not get reset properly (HcMac does
;									not do a RESET on restart, and has problems) Added deferred task
;									manager for onMacPP. Moved InitXVectTables to
;									InterruptHandlers.a, and renamed it InitIntHandler. Added
;									conditional support for Ram based onMacPP rom image. Added an
;									extra entry in the ROM header for HiRam to use to insert the ROM
;									Size. Contimued effort to make the ROM position independent,
;									allowing for an initial PC that assumes the ROM is mapped to
;									zero at start time, and the jumps into the real ROM space.
;									Changed RBV register usage now that equates are offsets from
;									RBVBase, instead of being absolute addresses.
;	   <3.8>	  3/3/89	CCH		Now initializes expandMem and Gestalt.

;	   <3.1>	 2/16/89	rwh		added support for Fitch Memory Controller rev 1, which has a
;									split memory model like MDU. WHen FMC2 arrives (contiguous
;									memory), remove these changes. Removed conditionals for
;									non-working Vias.
;	   <3.0>	 2/16/89	SES		Jumped around the remaining Ram test for hafMac. Will revisit
;									later.

;				$FFFFFFFF.  The end of the highest bank is 3 longwords after the terminator.
;
;				For instance, a two bank Mac 2 with 4 meg in bank A and 1 Meg in Bank B:
;

;						$00400000	- size bank A
;					a6->$00000000	- physical address Bank A
;
;		a5 ->	top of useable memory, given RAM disk.  This is only used on contiguous
;				memory systems that support RAM disks, such as the Portable.

;			The assumption made here (and other places where the CACR is manipulated) are
;			that if the bits specified in the CACRs above specified as having a value of
;			zero are written, those bits are ignored. All bits documented in the CACR as
;			zero are ALWAYS read as zeroes.  Given the placement of the various bits,
;			setting a bit that is valid in one of the MC68xxx processors that is undefined
;			(reserved, or zero) on others will be the method of CPU detection.

;
;	VIATime 5ca, in the IIci/IIfx/TERROR/HORROR ROMs, lives at 40x008BC.										<H11>
;														 --------
;	This means that the @loop    btst.b  #0,(A0)    is at 40x008C8, and the    dbra   d0,@loop				<H11>
;	is at 40x008CC.  This code, "half cache-line aligned, when run on an 040 and above, will execute		<H11>
;	in an on-chip cache SEPARATE FROM THE I-CACHE, called (appropriately), the DBRA-CACHE (not to be		<H11>
;	confused with the Zebra-cache, or any other African equine).  Why this is so important is that the		<H11>
;	memory address the BTST.B is referencing is a VIA (not surprising, since this is a loop that			<H11>
;	calculates Time-VIA-DB), and on 040s and above I/O space ($5xxxxxxx) is marked as non-cached and		<H11>
;	serialized.  At 20MHz and below, 040s will encounter a 'beat frequency' between the CPU and VIA			<H11>
;	clocks, which will cause the CPU to miss both edges of the VIA clock on the first pass.  This causes	<H11>
;	the CPU to have to wait an extra VIA clock cycle (1.2µs * 2 = 2.4µs) to access the register on the		<H11>
;	VIA about 21% of the time when running out of the DBRA CACHE.  However, if the loop is unaligned and	<H11>
;	does not run from the DBRA-cache and CPU = 040 @ ≤ 20MHz, it will synchronize with the VIA clock		<H11>
;	on the first VIA clock cycle ZERO percent of the time.  So, just to perform sadistic, saddalistic		<H11>
;	necroequinia, ALL unaligned loop VIA accesses at 20MHz and below will take 2.4µs.  This is important	<H11>
;	(you knew I'd get to this part eventually, right?) when using TimeVIADB as an EXACT time instead of		<H11>
;	a "minimum" type of timing constant.  Poignant example - {Drivers}Sony:SonyMFM.a in mWrData uses		<H11>
;	TimeVIADB to wait EXACTLY a certain amount of time (~ 235µs).  However, the constant generated from		<H11>
;	this loop when it is aligned is $2B0.  But 1ms/$2B0 ~= 1.45µs, which indicates the bias of 79% of the	<H11>
;	VIA accesses taking 1.2µs (1.2µs * (0.79 * $2B0) = 652µs) and 21% taking 2.4µs							<H11>
;	(2.4µs * (0.21 * $2B0) = 346µs), giving (652+346 = 998µs.  The loop in mWrData is unaligned so 100%		<H11>
;	of the VIA accesses will take 2.4µs.  So instead of the loop waiting 235µs (040 @ 20MHz = 162 times		<H11>
;	thru the loop; 162 * 1.45 = ~235), it actually waits 162 * 2.4 = ~389 µs.  This is bad since the		<H11>
;	reason why this loop is waiting is for the floppy drive head to reach the correct place at the start	<H11>
;	of a sector to begin writing and since that loop waits so long, sectors are written late and the		<H11>
;	floppy is trashed.																						<H11>
;
;	So by unaligning this loop it calculates a smaller number since each VIA access will then take 2.4µs	<H11>
;	and mWrData will work correctly.
;
;	In the case of 25MHz and above 040 processors, the rate that CPU and VIA clocks don't synchronize		<H11>
;	drops to ~ 1% and above that the CPU clock rate is fast enough that it always guarantees that it		<H11>
;	NEVER misses the first synchronization with the VIA clock.  Unaligning the loop has no effect on		<H11>
;	≥ 25MHz 040 processors.																					<H11>

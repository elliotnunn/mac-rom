;	Change History (most recent first):
;
;	  <SM10>	09-23-93	jmp		Quit doing <SM8> below when the Display Manager is around.
;	   <SM9>	 9/1/93		SKH		Fixed a bug with fixed CLUT devices (ie: DBLite).  SetEntries can not be called for
;									direct or fixed devices
;	   <SM8>	04-07-93	jmp		Cleaned up the invalid 'scrn' resource code so that it actually
;									removes the invalid 'scrn' resource.  This makes family modes
;									work better.  However, this is really only a stop-gap measure
;									for now.
;	   <SM7>	11-05-92	jmp		Changed the TPD, FPD, and HR video driver patch mechanism so
;									that it now runs correctly from ROM (it was originally written
;									to work in RAM).
;	   <SM6>	10/28/92	SWC		Changed SlotEqu.a->Slots.a and VideoEqu.a->Video.a.
;	   <SM5>	10/28/92	PN		# 1045532 Call QDSecondaryInit from the BootCode3.a to set up
;									the color and gdevice environment also fix up the code to run
;									from ROM and check for SuperMario ROM ID. Mike Puckett will come
;									back to this file and clean it up (he promised !) Also, take out
;									the system INIT stuff and the 950 patch.
;		<SM4>	10/27/92	CSS		Changed a short branch to a word branch.
;		<SM3>	7/16/92		CSS		Update from Reality:
;									<27> 7/13/92 DTY	#1035553 <csd>: The Quadra950VideoPatch assumes that the driver
;														is RAM based, thus it treats the dCtlDriver field as a handle.
;														Under A/UX, the video driver is a ROM based driver, and is a
;														pointer. Add a check to see whether the driver is RAM based or
;														ROM based before doing an extra dereference.
;									<26> 05-20-92 jmp	Moved the “PatchQuadra950Driver” code from VideoPatch.a to this
;														file so that the patch would work both when the Quadra 950
;														built-in video is the main device and when it is secondary.
;		 <2>	 2/13/92	PN		Add forRom conditionals.
;		 <1>						• Pre-SuperMario comments follow •
;		<25>	 8/23/91	JSM		Remove benign redefinition of TRUE, which is now defined by the
;									build script.
;		<24>	  3/7/91	DC		dba, #83785:  attach the VBL to the main screen after moving
;									cursor there
;		<23>	 11/7/90	jmp		Fixed a bug that I introduced iton SixPack where 'gama' tables
;									pointed to by the 'scrn' resource were not being loaded.
;		<22>	 7/11/90	gbm		define true (this was the only file that used it when it was in
;									StandardEqu.d)
;		<21>	 7/10/90	jmp		Added another item to the “To Do” list below. NO CODE CHANGES
;									WERE MADE.
;		<20>	 7/10/90	DDG		NEEDED FOR SIXPACK: Fixed bug in setting gamma entries
;									(SetDevGamma) where the csParam was being setup as if it was a
;									word instead of what it really is: a long. Also fixed duplicate
;									comment for change 19.
;		<19>	  7/4/90	jmp		Cleaned up and corrected MY previous inequities (and it’s about
;									time, too). ••• NEEDED FOR SIXPACK •••
;		<18>	  7/2/90	jmp		Move of the same -- rolling out my changes to fix the build.
;		<17>	  7/2/90	jmp		Put things back to the way they were because I was breaking
;									everybody (I’ll hang my head in shame).
;		<16>	  7/2/90	jmp		Took out <15> changes due to breaking build -- will put back in
;									later.
;		<15>	  7/2/90	jmp		Moved the NoScrn routine to CheckDeviceINIT.c in preparation for
;									$067C machine fix.
;		<14>	 6/29/90	jmp		Various small fixes, plus added some (badly needed) comments.
;		<13>	 6/28/90	DTY		Removed extra dereference on A2 when no 'scrn' resource is
;									around, which caused Bus Error on startup. (Oops… I [jmp] left some
;									bad parts of an attempted optimization in.)
;		<12>	 6/27/90	jmp		Fixed a problem where systems that do not have a 'scrn' resource
;									start out dark and then become light on the first SetGamma
;									and/or SetEntries call. ••• NEEDED FOR SIXPACK •••
;		<11>	  5/1/90	DDG		Changed a comment that indicated some permanent code was
;									temporary. (no code change)
;		<10>	 4/24/90	dba		make the cursor be on the main device, not the boot device
;		 <9>	 4/19/90	csd		corrected a typa for Darin who is completely without blame in
;									this matter
;		 <8>	 4/19/90	dba		change so this can be used by StartSystemPatches.a in 7.0
;		 <7>	 4/10/90	DF		<FOR 7.0 BUILD> Fix the interrupt handler patching code here to
;									correct illegal memory access when the driver is in ROM on
;									Erickson
;		 <6>	  3/2/90	DDG		Early in the boot process an _InitGraf was performed (for the
;									Welcome to Mac box).  It's not correct if the main screen moved
;									away from the boot screen, so let's call InitGraf on these early
;									globals to correct the problem. This will fix a problem with the
;									LMgr "init" which didn't do an InitGraf while setting up the
;									environment for an alert dialog. (this comment stolen from Brian
;									McGhie)
;		 <5>	  2/5/90	DAF		The INIT resource executing code at boot time requires that the
;									INIT resources not trash registers (particularily D6).  This fix
;									crudely saves and restores all register across calls.  It's
;									crude because this file is really about 3 independent inits
;									strung together
;		 <4>	  2/3/90	DAF		Added additional init functionality to file. This code
;									fixes a bug in the interrupt-level manipulation code in
;									several Apple drivers.
;		 <3>	 1/31/90	DAF		Added an AllocCursor before the ShowCursor at the end of the
;									init to make sure all data structures are properly setup
;		 <2>	 1/30/90	DAF		Added secondary function which sets a GDFlag bit to identify
;									32-bit addressed frame buffers.
;	   <1.0>	 9/21/89	DAF		FOR 6.0.4 Build - Color QuickDraw CheckDevices System Init
;	   <1.1>	 8/17/89	DAF		Commented a test out (;!!!) to force the gamma and gray state to
;									be flushed out to the CLUT hardware with a SetEntries.
;
;	To Do:
;	 	To eliminate flashing, it would be nice to keep some sort of tally about which
;		gDevices have already had SetEntries/SetGamma calls made to them.  The cases
;		where this would occur are rare, but it should be looked into.
;
;	 	This code contains lots of jumping around, and it would be nice to eliminate it.
;
;	 	In the ••• 3rd INIT ••• there a several “Move.l DeviceList,Ax”.  It might be
;		nice to use something like A5 (since it’s free and all the registers are
;		being saved) to just cache the DeviceList.
;
;	 	If the above is implemented, the SetDevEntries and SetDevGamma utilites could
;		be tightened up to some degree (i.e, saving of input register(s)).
;	
;	    SetDevEntries and SetDevGamma should return _Control errors.  (This would be handy
;		in the 4th INIT when SetDevGamma fails -- e.g., the card doesn’t support it -- so
;		that the subsequent SetDevEntries call is NOT made.)
;			
; This system file INIT basically contains the CheckDevices routine from within Color QuickDraw
;	(this excerpt from gdevice.a).  This INIT runs only on CQD machines.
;
; This routine normally performs validations on the 'scrn' resource and sets up the color
;	and gDevice environment.  It fixes two bugs.  The first is related to gamma tables
;	specified by ID in the 'scrn' resource.  Previously, if a gamma table was specified, but a
;	color table ID was NOT specified, the gamma setting would not take place until the next
;	change of the device's color table.  The second is an improvement of the 'scrn' validation code.
;	If a mode (screen depth) is recorded in the 'scrn' resource, but that mode becomes unavailable
;	(through removal of frame buffer memory), then an invalid mode may be selected.  This INIT
;	corrects that problem by validating the mode field.
;
; Since this routine is fairly large, and only executes once, I'm executing this code as a System
;	INIT before the first _InitGraf.  The code in ROM will see that the allInit flag is set, and will
;	just skip over the faulty code in ROM.  There's no attempt to modify the ROM version.
;
; I’ve left this code as close to CheckDevices as possible.  Live code that has been left out of
;	this init version is marked with ';+++'.
;
; UPDATE FOR 6.0.5:  I've added another INIT function to the tail end of the main Init.  This
;	code tests each frame buffer in the system, and sets a bit in GDFlags of it's gDevice if
;	the frame buffer is to be addressed in 32-bit addressing mode.  Addressing mode is independent
;	of pixelsize.  Only 32-bit QD equipped machines can use these frame buffers, but the
;	design of the video card architecture protects non-QD 32 machines.
;
; UPDATE FOR SixPack: I (jmp) have essentially added three more INIT functions.  Two of these end
;	up jumping to the same piece of code, and the third (although it uses some of the code from
;	the first two) is totally different.  The addeded functionality in the first two INIT functions
;	is to correct the problem where there is no and/or no valid 'scrn' resource in the System.  To do
;	this we just call SetEntries on the boot device’s pmTable.  The other problem is a little more
;	subtle and only happens on $067C machines.  The problem is that InitDefGamma (in StartInit)
;	doesn’t set up non-TFB, non-gamma dir cards at all.  So, the INIT here is does a SetEntries
;	and SetGamma on $067C machines on all non-TFB cards that contain no gamma directories.

; ••• 5th INIT •••
;
;----------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Here's the other init in the file.  It scans the device list frame buffers
;	and sets a flag in the gDevice if the frame buffer is addressed in 32-bit
;	mode.  It's kind of slobby looking to hook this onto the end of the other
;	init instead of integrating, but it's small, and the CheckDevices code
;	goes to great lengths to exit early when it can, which this cannot do.
;
;----------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Yet a another function co-exists with the others in this file.  If we recognize
;	an Apple Video card who's interrupt handler needs to be fixed, we will do it here.
;	Here's the problem: In an attempt to simplify the driver code while correcting some
;	of my VBL polling code, I raised the interrupt level to level-7 while waiting for
;	the leading edge of VBL.  Unfortunately, this can lead to a (eternally long) wait
;	of up to one active screen for the next leading edge.  In earlier versions, I
;	forced the SR to $2200 which got level-2 interrupts (good) and forced the interrupt
;	stack pointer (bad).  When the interrupt level is raised to level-7, the SCC and
;	everything else is blocked out which can cause loss of data on the serial ports.
;	This new replacement code will raise the level to level-2 if it isn't higher already
;	but won't change it if it is 3 or higher.  This code is quite a bit larger than the
;	original code, but fortunately, the drivers are all in RAM, so it's easy to patch
;	them all out.
;
; We modify four different types of drivers.  All drivers share the same faulty code,
;	so we fix them all by installing a single copy of the updated interrupt code in the
;	system heap, identifying which drivers are subject to patch, then pointing them at the
;	new interrupt code.  We identify the drivers via a few bytes of code that have significant
;	values such as the name strings.  We don't need to do a full compare, or check version
;	numbers since we will verify the object code in the driver as well.  If the faulty code
;	isn't there, then we don't have to replace it!  The drivers are always locked, so this
;	is pretty safe (they must be locked since the interrupt handler is included within the
;	driver proper).
;
; Here are the video cards modified:
;		1) Mac IIci Built-In Video Driver    (.Display_Video_Apple_RBV1) [Only when this code is built as a patch.]
;		2) Mac II High-Resolution Video Card (.Display_Video_Apple_HRVC)
;		3) Mac II Two-Page Video Card        (.DrWVC) [ROM Version WVC1.2, P/N 341-0727]
;		4) Mac II Portrait Video Card        (.DrPVC) [ROM Version PVC1.1, P/N 341-0732]

			BRA		DoDrvrPatches			; Stupid extra branch because I calculate the size of the
											;   resident interrupt handler from labels, and they can't
											;	be forward references. <15>: Changed name from Start to

;----- Memory/ROM-Resident Interrupt Handler Patch ------
;
; Here is the improved interrupt level setting code.  It's a little weird looking since I
